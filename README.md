# GroceryStroreForm

In particular, this is a form for client side only, I have not done any server-side work in it. In other words, it is a static page and have some dynamic features. Some JS components like onclick, alert, regEx (for validation of input) etc are used in it. Basically, it takes a grocery store order and some information like Name, Phone number etc by any client or user or costumer and after validating every field, shows a summary of that order by doing some internal calculations with the help of JS. It is styled so well with CSS.
And after submitting and reviewing the order summary, it shows an alert box with a confirmation message.
